# Instapaper Keyboard Shortcut Chrome Extension

This is a Chrome extension to provide a keyboard shortcut for adding a page to the Read Later list in Instapaper.
It is inspired by and based on [Bertrand Fan's][1] [pinboard-keyboard-shortcut][2] extension.

The current keyboard shortcut is Command+Shift+P on OS X and Alt+P on other platforms.

The standard Instapaper JavaScript is used so the behaviour should be identical to using the Instapaper bookmarklet.
